High-liquidity items (large, steady daily volume; small price swings)
— Prefer slower/longer moving averages (e.g., 14, 21, 30 days…)

Low-liquidity items (spiky, rare trades; big price jumps)
— Prefer faster/shorter moving averages (e.g., 3, 5, 7 days…)

Dangers: 

Over-smoothing: Too long an MA “smooths out” real trends, making you react too slowly.
Problem: Curve Fitting / Overfitting: Chasing the “perfect” window for past data can lead to picking settings that don’t work in the future.
Solutions: Out-Of-Sample Validation, Rolling Optimization, "Robust" Parameters(correlated products).
